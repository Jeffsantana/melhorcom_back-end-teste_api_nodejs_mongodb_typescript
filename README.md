Need new modules? The module contains everything with direct relation. Like a models, controllers, use cases, routes. Create a new path with name of new module, and four paths inside: controllers, models, routes and useCases. 

We use class, is good! 

Creating new controllers
If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file with class and export in /src/app/modules/new_module/controllers/NewController.ts 

Creating new models
If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file with class and export in /src/app/modules/new_module/models/NewModel.ts

Creating new routes
If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file with class and export in /src/app/modules/new_module/routes/index.ts and load+export this file in /src/app/routes/index.js
